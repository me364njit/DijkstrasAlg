# DijkstrasAlg

The class's methods implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path. The algorithm maintains a priority queue (unvisited) of vertices with their associated costs. It iteratively selects the vertex with the lowest cost from the priority queue and updates the costs of neighboring vertices. The algorithm continues until all vertices are visited or the desired end vertex is reached. The paths and costs maps are used to store the calculated paths and costs for each vertex.

This implementation follows the principles of Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find the shortest paths in a graph. Please note that this explanation provides a high-level overview of the implementation. It's important to have a good understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm and the provided code to effectively use and extend this class for your purposes.
